## Potential improvements
Basically, because it's just a test task it doesn't have a lot of things to be ready for production:

1. Proper logging
2. Metrics collection
3. Configuration for different envs
4. Proper DB client (just stores tasks in a memory because it was allowed by the task description)
5. Unit, integration tests 
6. Requests validation
7. Some edge cases might be not covered
8. Auth
9. etc etc
